Can guests interact with my Google connected home devices? \nResponse: Yes, anyone invited into your home may be able to interact with your Google connected home devices and services. \n\n2. What information does Google collect from my Nest thermostat? \nResponse: Google collects data from several sensors built into the Nest thermostat, such as current temperature, humidity, motion, and ambient light in the room. \n\n3. How can I change my privacy settings for a Google connected home device? \nResponse: To change your privacy settings for a device after the initial setup, make sure your mobile device or tablet is connected to the same Wi-Fi or linked to the same account as your Chromecast, or speaker or display. Open the Google Home app, touch and hold your device's tile, and tap Settings > Recognition & sharing. \n\n4. What is ARPA-H and how can it help with health breakthroughs? \nResponse: ARPA-H is the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more. ARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\n5. What is Federated Learning and how does it work with Google Assistant? \nResponse: Federated Learning allows Assistant to update our machine learning models without sending the text you speak, images from your camera (if you enable camera sensing), or other data from your devices back to Google servers for such learning.

          "In the event of a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, personal information may be among the items sold or transferred, but Nest will request a purchaser to treat their data under the privacy statement in place at the time of its collection. Nest may also provide information to a third party if they believe in good faith that they are required to do so for legal reasons. However, under no circumstance does Nest share personal information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the activation and delivery of Nest Products and services without asking the user first. Nest also sends an email to the user account before disclosing information when they receive a request from a government agency, unless legally prohibited under the terms of the request. The way they respond to a request depends on the user's Google service provider, which is either Google LLC, a US company operating under US law, or Google Ireland Limited, an Irish company operating under Irish law. They carefully review each request to make sure it satisfies applicable laws and share the number and types of requests they receive in their Transparency Report. ",
